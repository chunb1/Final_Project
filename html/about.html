                    <p>Living in Portland has always been an amazing experience and 
                        really eye opening in terms of food and how different areas
                         of the world differ and are similar in their cuisine. As a 
                         kid, I was also very interested in computers, technology, 
                         and math, so when I saw that coding was an available class 
                         at my school, I knew I had to take it, and I'm glad I did. 
                         When we had to brainstorm for ideas for our final website, 
                         I thought, what a great time for me to combine 2 things 
                        that I'm very passionate about, food and website development</p>

                    <p>Hello! My name is Sam. I am 16 years old and am just like you.
                        I live in Portland, ME and go to Portland High School. 
                        I originally created this website with the idea of spreading
                        knowledge about your own home town without having to 
                        explore every square inch of wherever it is that you live,
                        and I thought what better way to do that than knowing 
                        about the restaurants in your area. Food n Stuff isn't a 
                        food delivery website, but rather a way to expand your 
                        taste and deepen your pallet. Some aspects of my website 
                        include the distance from your restaurant of choice, 
                        the cuisine of said restaurant, and some ratings.</p>
